# OpenProject Plugins Plugin

This plugin aims to make writing plugins easier. It provides a generator for creating a basic plugin structure and a module that simplifies setting up the plugin Rails engine. Thus, it is also a dependency for many plugins.

## Usage

Make sure to include the plugins plugin before all other plugins in your Gemfile, otherwise the module used by the plugin Rails engines (`OpenProject::Plugins::ActsAsOpEngine`) is not available when a plugin is being loaded.

### Generator

    bundle exec rails generate open_project:plugin <plugin name> <target folder>

The generator will create a new subfolder within `<target folder>`, named `openproject-<plugin name>`.

Example:

    bundle exec rails generate open_project:plugin xls_export .

### ActsAsOpEngine

The generated engine uses `ActsAsOpEngine` by default, so just have a look at this file.
For more information on how to use `ActsAsOpEngine`, just see the comments in its [source code](lib/open_project/plugins/acts_as_op_engine.rb).
It offers methods to load patches and register assets besides others.

#### Example
```ruby
module OpenProject::RepositoryAuthentication
  class Engine < ::Rails::Engine
    engine_name :openproject_repository_authentication

    include OpenProject::Plugins::ActsAsOpEngine

    register 'openproject-repository_authentication',
             :author_url => 'http://finn.de',
             :requires_openproject => '>= 3.0.0' do
      menu :project_menu,
           :repo_auth,
           {:controller => '/repo_auth_controller', :action => :index},
           :caption => "Repo Auth!"
    end

    patches [:SysController]
  end
end
```

## Caveats

### db:create and db:migrate

When using OpenProject plugins, you can't use the `db:create` and `db:migrate` within one rake process, i.e. `rake db:create db:migrate` will not work. It would only run core migrations, but not plugin migrations.

Here's an explanation for this behavior:

> db:create invokes db:load_config. db:load_config collects migration paths, but the
> migration paths for plugins are set on the Engine config when the application
> is initialized, which the environment task does. The environment task is only later
> executed as dependency for db:migrate. db:migrate also depends on load_config, but since
> it has been executed before, rake doesn't execute it a second time.
> Loading the environment bevore explicitly executing db:load_config (not only invoking it)
> makes rake execute it a second time after the environment has been loaded.
> Loading the environment before db:create does not work, since initializing the application
> depends on an existing databse.
