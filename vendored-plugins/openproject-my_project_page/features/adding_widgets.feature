  Background:
    Given there is 1 project with the following:
      | name        | project1      |
    And there is a role "Admin"
    And there is a role "Manager"
    And I am already Admin
    And I am on the project "project1" overview personalization page

    And "Watched work packages" should be disabled in the my project page available widgets drop down
